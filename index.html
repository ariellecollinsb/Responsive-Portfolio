                Hello, my name is Arielle Collins. I am currently enrolled as a student,
                at the University of Denver's Full Stack Development, Bootcamp.
                My professional and academic background is in Journalism, and Mass Communication.
                Upon relocating to Colorado, I jumped at the opportunity to learn something
                completely new, ultimately expanding my skill-set.
                I never had a true understanding or appreciation for what it took to make
                a website at the most basic, or maintain a server at the most advanced levels.
                On my portfolio page, I will link program assignments, and group project work,
                showing my ability to apply what I've learned.
                This website will continue to be developed as my understanding and ability increases.
